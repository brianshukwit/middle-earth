    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <h4>Goals:</h4>
    <p>The goal of <b>Books for All, All for Books</b> is to bring books and the joy of reading to all. 
        When you purchase a book the price you pay goes to buying that book for a school of your choices.
        That school will be gifted with the book to their Library so that kids all over can read
        and have a chance to expand their horizons.<p>
    <br>
    <p>Books will change weekly to allow variety.</p>
